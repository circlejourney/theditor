    <b>1.7.2 (27 October 2022):</b> The site has migrated to a new server and I forgot to update my Cloudflare records to point to the new address...until loads of people had noticed the website was down. Apologies for the inconvenience and thanks for letting me know!
    </p>
    <p>
        While I'm here, I figured I'd make the much-requested update to Font Awesome 6. Many many thanks again to alyeong for the subscription! As always, let me know if you see any unusual behaviour.

        Finally, I'm running a poll about the import feature. <a href="https://toyhou.se/~forums/26276.polls/343947.do-you-use-the-code-editor-s-import-feature-">Check it out here!</a>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.7.1 (3 July 2022):</b> Synced the source files to Toyhouse's May update. I previously attempted this and it didn't work out of the box, so I've given it a more careful treatment.
</p>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.7.0 (17 June 2022):</b> Birthday update! Requests fulfilled: low contrast toggle, blurb editing. Reorganised UI toggles into their own menu. Also added the new mascot image. As always, do let me know if you run into any bugs!
</p>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.6.1 (22 May 2022):</b> Reverted a number of changes from the last update because it was breaking the editor. Apologies for not catching that before pushing it out! Will update the code at a later time.
</p>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.6.0 (16 May 2022):</b> Updated the source files to match Toyhouse's recent update, and made another (hopefully final) effort at improving the cache busting. Removed unstable version and now managing watermark feature via Github.
</p>
<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.5.4 (9 May 2022):</b> The project now has <a href="https://toyhou.se/~world/69886.code-editor-discussion/forums">a World</a> where you can share ideas and vote on issues/suggestions! For this update, I also made some QOL fixes like HTML panel toggle, big text size toggle and made clicking outside the info modal close the modal.
</p>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.5.3 (2 February 2022):</b> Hard reset was necessary and hard to locate, so I added a hard reset link on the loading page. This will hopefully help with situations where the code editor breaks due to issues with the code. You can also hard reset by typing <code>Please reset!</code> in the HTML panel. Better error handling is pending. Also, "Latest update" badge now updates automatically.
</p>

<p class="changelog-item">
	<b>1.5.2 (30 December 2021):</b> Reorganisation and cache busting the old fashioned way. There may be linkage issues with older versions. Will fix them as I find them!
</p>

<p class="changelog-item">
	<b>1.5.1 (11 November 2021):</b> Migrated to the Git repository! You can clone it and make pull requests <a href="https://github.com/circlejourney/theditor">here</a>.
</p class="changelog-item">

<div class="changelog-item">
    <p>
        <b>1.5.0 (6 October 2021, Theme Designer Support):</b> Added new layouts:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Character basic tab</li>
        <li>Character gallery (static)</li>
        <li>Character library (static)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also added a sidebar toggle and image lightbox, and updated the folder layout to include pagination. These changes will hopefully help CSS theme designers. Feel free to let me know if you run into any problems!</p>
</div>

<p class="changelog-item"><b>1.4.2 (7 July 2021):</b> Updated Import feature. To prevent the import of codes you do not have rights to use, only profiles with the string <code>allow-thcj-import</code> can be imported. Please paste the following line into your profile to enable import: <code>&lt;span id="allow-thcj-import"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code>. I know it is a little tedious, but it is the best solution I've got as of now, without an API.</p>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.4.1 (7 July 2021):</b> Temporarily disabled the import feature while I add security measures. Thanks for understanding!
</p class="changelog-item">

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.4.0 (6 July 2021, Data Imports):</b> Added data import feature, Warning layout and a button to insert lorem ipsum text. Enter the character ID (a string of numbers) or username to import a profile. It has to be public and have no warning.</p>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.3.6 (22 June 2021):</b> <a href="/unstable">New unstable update</a>&mdash;I'm testing a feature that lets you import data from character and user profiles to fill the template (replacing the placeholders)! Definitely report any bugs or issues to me, I don't know how well it functions on devices with lower processor capabilities.
</p>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.3.5 (21 June 2021):</b> Removed the quick fix from 2 January (which applied a specific resizing code to mobile Safari). If you are a Safari user and have started having problems that you did not have before, please let me know! In the backend, I've also added some auto cache-busting so hopefully there will be fewer problems with source files not updating.
</p>

<div class="changelog-item">
<p><b>1.3.4 (30 April 2021):</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a vertical layout toggle to better utilise screen space for people with smaller desktop screens. Thank you <a href="https://toyhou.se/coro">coro</a> for the suggestion! Do let me know if you run into any issues using it or have suggestions for improvement.</li>
<li>For usability reasons, I have also added a hard reset function that clears all drafts and settings. To perform a hard reset, simply type <b>Please reset!</b> in the HTML area to get the prompt, and click OK.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.3.3 (27 March 2021):</b> Added SASS support back on request.
</p class="changelog-item">

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.3.2 (4 February 2021):</b> I have rolled back to the 14 January version while I properly iron out the tab remembering feature, since I was receiving a number of bug reports. Thanks for your patience and sorry for the inconvenience!
</p class="changelog-item">

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.3.1 (28 January 2021):</b> Added a much-requested feature: the editor now remembers what tab you were on and automatically remains on that tab even when the code is updated. I have only tested this on Chrome and Firefox so do let me know if you run into any problems on other browsers. Still pending a fix for the inability to highlight text on mobile browsers.
</p>

<div class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.3.0 (14 January 2021, No More Rectangles):</b> Installed some icon sets! <i class="far fa-grin-hearts"> </i> <span class="fi-heart"></span>
    <ul>
        <li>At long last, I have installed Font Awesome Pro, with many thanks to <a href="https://toyhou.se/alyeong">alyeong</a>! All Font Awesome icons should now appear as intended. (Do note that the version of FA installed here is actually <i>more recent</i> than Toyhouse's, so some icons that appear here may not show up on TH!)</li>
        <li>While I'm at it, I also installed Foundation Icons, which TH uses in some of its UI elements; I did not realise this until today.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug that was preventing CSS code from being autosaved.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="changelog-item">
   <p>
       <b>1.2.3 (10 January 2021):</b>
   </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Added <a href="../unstable">unstable preview</a> where hopefully I'll be able to get more help with bugtesting before updates go live.
        </li>
        <li>
            (Under the hood) the editor now pulls notes, changelog, known issues and version list from the same files across all versions (starting from this version). This will hopefully help with organisation!
        </li>
        <li>
            Also, I've added a rewrite rule that should circumvent the cached file problem by automatically adding cache-busting IDs. Let me know if you run into any trouble with files not loading.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.2.2 (2 January 2021):</b> Quick fix for a bug that was making the editor fields resize incorrectly in Safari. I have only been able to test it in Chrome, Firefox and Safari for iPad; if you run into any problems in other browsers, let me know!
</p>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.2.1 (28 December 2020):</b> Important bug fix for a problem that was breaking the editor (the regex pattern I was using to strip code of script and style tags had a typo). It should work now, but still do not hesitate to let me know if you've found any problems!
    <br>
    I also added a few changes to improve mobile display. Resizing should now work on mobile and I have a button for toggling the editor panel visibility. I am testing these through Chrome dev tools, so let me know if it's working right on mobile! 
</p>

<div class="changelog-item">
    <p>
        <b>1.2.0 (27 December 2020, the Big Cleanup I):</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Added buttons that allow you to download your code as .txt files. Thank you <a href="https://toyhou.se/anisoptera-eyes">anisoptera-eyes</a> for the suggestion!</li>
        <li>Clear button added.</li>
        <li>Added a text scratchpad as requested. Thank you <a href="https://toyhou.se/Miner5431">Miner5431</a> for the suggestion!</li>
        <li>Under the hood: the preview window is now housed in an iframe. This should prevent issues with class name conflicts that were popping up quite frequently.</li>
        <li>Toggle button for mobile view added and generally made it more friendly to mobile users.</li>
        <li>Overhauled resizing&mdash;it resizes far more smoothly now.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.1.7 (13 September 2020):</b> Moved all page layout templates to separate files for organisational reasons, added navigation bar.
</p>
<p>
    <b>1.1.6 (1 June 2020):</b> Copied all Toyhouse CSS and JS files to my server, to prevent cross-origin request errors. They will be manually updated whenever Toyhouse updates its files.

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.1.4 (14 December 2019):</b> Added a hotfix that slows down the page update rate (when Auto-update is turned on) to prevent webpage display crash errors. May return to this in the future to implement a more elegant solution.

<p class="changelog-item">
    <b>1.1.3 (5 November 2019):</b> Clicking in the HTML and CSS text areas to bring them into focus now makes the placeholder text disappear.
